<h1>Smart Security System with ESP8266</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project implements a smart security system using the ESP8266 microcontroller along with a PIR sensor for motion detection, a flame sensor for fire detection, and an MQ-5 gas sensor for gas leak detection. Alerts are sent to a Telegram bot, providing real-time notifications for potential hazards.

#Features
Real-time Monitoring: Detects motion, fire, and gas leaks.
Instant Alerts: Sends notifications through a Telegram bot.
Easy Setup: Simple wiring and code configuration.

#Components Required:
ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module (NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini)
PIR Motion Sensor
Flame Sensor
MQ-5 Gas Sensor
Jumper wires
Breadboard(optional)
Power supply

#Usage
Once the system is set up, it continuously monitors the environment. When motion, fire, or gas is detected, a message is sent to your Telegram bot, alerting you of the potential hazard.

#Future Enhancements
Integrate with a mobile app for more features.
Add more sensors (e.g., door/window sensors).
Implement a web dashboard for monitoring.

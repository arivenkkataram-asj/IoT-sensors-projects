# 🔧 Embedded IoT Projects Collection

Welcome to the **Embedded IoT Projects Collection** — a set of mini-projects that combine embedded systems and IoT principles using a variety of sensors, actuators, and communication protocols.

Each project is developed using microcontrollers like **ESP32**, **RP2040**, and Arduino focuses on encourage to learn the embedded systems.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🐾 1. Pet Feeder using Servo Motor and pir
- Automatically dispenses food using a servo motor
- sensor-activated system

### 🚶‍♂️ 2. PIR Sensor-Based Motion Detector
- Detects motion using a PIR sensor
- Activates buzzer and LED upon movement
- Useful for pet monitoring systems

### 🔥 3. Smart-security_telegram_bot
- Detects flame or high temperature conditions
- Detects the leakage of LPG gas using the MQ-2 sensor
- Activates alert (buzzer/LED) and sends the notification to the telegram bot.

### 🌡️ 4. Smart_irrigation
- Uses DHT11 to read environmental data
- Data sent via MQTT the data is processed in the node-red using the equation of the Penmann moith evopration
- Logs values periodically by time stamp
  
### ☀️ 5. Solar Panel Tracking System (LDR-Based)
- Dual LDRs track sunlight and rotate solar panel using servo
- Tracks according to the LDR resistive value

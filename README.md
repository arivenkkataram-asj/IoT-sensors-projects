The Smart Security System uses an ESP8266 with a PIR sensor for motion detection, a flame sensor for fire detection, and an MQ-5 gas sensor for gas leaks. Integrated with a Telegram bot, it sends real-time alerts to your mobile device, enhancing home safety. This easy-to-set-up project effectively safeguards your environment from potential hazards.
